# DataScience
In this repository, I showcase my efforts of developing a skillset in the Data Science.  Here I have provided some sample code that I have written during my progression through the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree as well as some Ipython notebooks that I have created for other to enjoy if they so desire.  I will also host my code of my sample projects that I plan on completing in the future here.
