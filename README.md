# DataScience
In this repository, I showcase my efforts from the Intro to Data Science Course from Udacity.  Here I have provided some sample code that I have written during my progression through the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree as well as some Ipython notebooks that I have created for other to enjoy if they so desire.
